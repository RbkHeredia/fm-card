# second challenge

This is my second Frontend Mentor challenge, I chose a basic card that took me approximately 2 hours. I used react as framework, styling the components with css.
On this occasion I took the opportunity to use the Vite compiler, since create-react-app is no longer current, it was a fast and agile experience for me.
